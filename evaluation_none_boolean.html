	<h1>Expressions</h1>
	<div class="subject">
		<p>
		An <b>expression</b> in python is simply a <b>line of code that evaluates to an object</b>. In python, these lines are <b>composed of objects and function calls</b> (we will get to functions later) <b>separated by</b> things called <b>operators</b>. The objects are, of course, referenced by one of their names. These things called <b>operators</b> are like "+" and "-": they <b>take two objects and evaluate them to a third</b>. Right now, it isn't important that you know what operators you can use in python. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Here is a simple expression:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code>1 + 1</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		This expression has two objects (in this case numbers) separated by the operator of addition. This of course evaluates to the number 2.
		</p>
		<p>
		Expressions don't have to have operators in them. They can instead be a single object or function call. Here is an example of the simplest expression you can have:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code>1</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		This expression just evaluates to <code>1</code> itself.
		</p>
		<h4>Order of Operations</h4>
		<p>
		Now consider the expression <code>1 + 2 * 3</code>. A question arises: does the multiplication operator take, for its two objects, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, or <code>3</code> and <code>3</code>. In other words, does <code>1 + 2</code> evaluate first, or does <code>2 * 3</code>? In order to answer to question, <b>python has a strict order of operations</b>. I will show you this ordering over time as you learn the various operators.
		</p>
		<h4>Controlling the Order of Operations</h4>
		<p>
		There is one way that you can always control the order of operations. Any <b>part of an expression surrounded by parenthesis</b>, specifically "(" and ")", <b>will be evaluated before the rest of the expression</b> is evaluated. Therefore:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code>(1 + 2) * 3</code> becomes <code>3 * 3</code>
		</p>
		<p><code>1 + (2 * 3)</code> becomes <code>1 + 6</code></p>
		<p>Finally <b>you can</b> always <b>put parenthesis</b> inside other parenthesis:</p>
		<p>
		<code>((2 + 3) + (3 - 2) * 2) * 3</code> becomes <code>(5 + 1 * 2) * 3</code>
		</p>

	<h1>None</h1>
	<div class="subject">
	<p>
	<b><code>None</code></b> is a special python object that is used to represent the lack of an object. So when a line of code should evaluate to nothing, it evaluates to <b>python's version of nothing</b>, <code>None</code>, which is still an object. Note that like any other object, you can assign <code>None</code> any number of other names.
	</p>
	</div>
	<h1>Booleans: True and False</h1>
	<div class="subject">
	<p>
	<b><code>True</code> and <code>False</code></b>, called booleans, are two special objects. In python, <b>every object</b> not only evaluates to itself, but <b>also evaluates to one of these two</b>. And the rules for what evaluates to what are quite simple. I'll divide them up by the type of object (and don't worry if some of this doesn't make sense, it will become clear as we move along).
	</p>
	<div class="howto">
	<h3>Who Evaluates to What</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Sequences and Dictionaries</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Ones without elements evaluate to <code>False</code></li>
			<li>Ones with elements evaluate to <code>True</code></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Numbers</li>
		<ul>
			<li>0 evaluates to <code>False</code></li>
			<li>Everynumber that isn't 0 evaluates to <code>True</code></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Booleans</li>
		<ul>
			<li><code>False</code> is <code>False</code></li>
			<li><code>True</code> is <code>True</code></li>
		</ul>
		<li>All Other Objects</li>
		<ul>
			<li><code>None</code> evaluates to <code>False</code></li>
			<li>Everything else evaluates to <code>True</code> (unless otherwise stated)</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
	Finally <b>there are three ways you can combine <code>True</code> and <code>False</code></b> to get either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>: <b><code>and</code>, <code>not</code>, and <code>or</code></b>. And they are just like their english versions!
