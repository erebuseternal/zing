	<h1>Expressions</h1>
	<div class="subject">
		<p>
		An <b>expression</b> in python is a <b>line of code that evaluates to an object</b>. These lines are <b>composed of objects and function calls</b> (we will get to functions later) <b>separated by operators</b>. Operators take two objects and produce a third from them.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here is a simple expression:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code>1 + 1</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		This expression has two objects (in this case numbers) separated by the operator of addition. This of course evaluates to the number 2.
		</p>
		<p>
		Expressions don't have to have operators in them. Here is an example of the simplest expression you can have:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code>1</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		This expression evaluates to one of course.
		</p>
		<p>But once again, expression are simply objects and function calls strung together with operators. And 
		all expressions evaluate to an object.
		</p>
		<h4>Order of Operations</h4>
		<p>
		Now take the expression <code>1 + 2 * 3</code>. If we evaluate it using normal order of operations it evaluates to <code>7</code>. If we evaluate it strictly from left to right we get <code>6</code>. To remove this ambiguity, python has a strict order of operations. More often than not this is not going to be strictly from left to right. So how are they ordered? We will learn to that as we learn the operations that you can use.
		</p>
		<p>
		But there is one way that you can always control the order of operations. Any part of an expression surrounded by parenthesis, specifically "(" and ")", will be evaluated before the rest of the expression is evaluated. Therefore:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code>(1 + 2) * 3</code>
		</p>
		<p>becomes</p>
		<p><code>3 * 3</code></p>
		<p>and similarly</p>
		<p><code>1 + (2 * 3)</code></p>
		<p>becomes</p>
		<p>1 + 6</p>

	<h1>None</h1>
	<div class="subject">
	<p>
	<b><code>None</code></b> is a special python object that is used to represent the lack of an object. So when a line of code should evaluate to nothing, it evaluates to <b>python's version of nothing</b>, <code>None</code>, which is still an object. Note that like any other object, you can assign <code>None</code> any number of other names.
	</p>
	</div>
	<h1>Booleans: True and False</h1>
	<div class="subject">
	<p>
	<b><code>True</code> and <code>False</code></b>, called booleans, are two special objects. In python, <b>every object</b> not only evaluates to itself, but <b>also evaluates to one of these two</b>. And the rules for what evaluates to what are quite simple. I'll divide them up by the type of object (and don't worry if some of this doesn't make sense, it will become clear as we move along).
	</p>
	<div class="howto">
	<h3>Who Evaluates to What</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Sequences and Dictionaries</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Ones without elements evaluate to <code>False</code></li>
			<li>Ones with elements evaluate to <code>True</code></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Numbers</li>
		<ul>
			<li>0 evaluates to <code>False</code></li>
			<li>Everynumber that isn't 0 evaluates to <code>True</code></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Booleans</li>
		<ul>
			<li><code>False</code> is <code>False</code></li>
			<li><code>True</code> is <code>True</code></li>
		</ul>
		<li>All Other Objects</li>
		<ul>
			<li><code>None</code> evaluates to <code>False</code></li>
			<li>Everything else evaluates to <code>True</code> (unless otherwise stated)</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
	Finally <b>there are three ways you can combine <code>True</code> and <code>False</code></b> to get either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>: <b><code>and</code>, <code>not</code>, and <code>or</code></b>. And they are just like their english versions!
