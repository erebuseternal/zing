	<h1>Conditionals</h1>
	<div class="subject">
	<h4>Why</h4>
	<p>
	<b>Conditionals allow you to</b> have code that only gets executed when a certain condition is satisfied. This means that you can <b>make your code act differently under different conditions</b>.
	</p>
	<h4>What</h4>
	<p>
	Conditionals are made of blocks written one after another. Python knows these blocks are tied together because of the keywords they use. Each block's <span style="color:yellow">identifying text</span> is an expression that will act as a condition. On execution Python will begin looking at the blocks' expressions in order. Once it finds an expression that evaluates to True, it will execute that block's code and then skip the rest of the blocks. Therefore <b>the first component who's expression is true is the only one that has it's code run</b>. This is so that if you have many pieces of code for completely different situations only one will execute per situation. On the other hand, if you want many pieces to execute per situation you can always write several conditionals.
	</p>
	<h4>How</h4>
	<p>
	So what are the rules for writing conditionals? As was stated above, writing conditionals is as simple as writing out its blocks one after the other. So here are the rules for those blocks.
	</p>
	<div class="howto">
	<h3>Rules for Writing the Blocks that Comprise Conditionals</h3>
	<h4>Keywords</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>First block's keyword is an <code>if</code></li>
		<li>Subsequent blocks use <code>elif</code> as their keyword</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Identifying Text</h4>
	<p>
	Just a python expression. Use the expression that gives you the condition you want.
	</p>
	<h4>Code</h4>
	<p>
	You can use loops, expressions and/or more conditionals. Other than that it is completely up to you!
	</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Optional Final Block</h4>
	<p>
	If you have multiple blocks, there is an optional final block that you can use which does not have identfying text. It looks like this:
	</p>
	<p><code>
	else:</br>
	&nbsp;some code
	</code></p>
	<p>
	If this block is part of your conditional and none of the other blocks are executed, this one will be. Therefore, it is a shorter way of writing this as your last block.
	</p>
	<p><code>
	elif True:</br>
	&nbsp;some code
	</code></p>
