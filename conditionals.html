	<h1>Conditionals</h1>
	<div class="subject">
	<h4>What are Conditionals for?</h4>
	<p>
	<b>Conditionals allow you to</b> have code that only gets executed when a certain condition is satisfied. This means that you can <b>make your code act differently under different conditions</b>.
	</p>
	<div class="little_example">
	<p>
	As an example, conditionals allow me to create a program that tells me "good morning" if the time is before 12:00 p.m. but tells me "good afternoon" if the time is after 12:00 p.m.
	</p>
	</div>
	<h4>How are Conditionals Constructed?</h4>
	<p>
	Conditionals are constructed from a set of components written one after another. Each component is composed of:
	</p>
	<div class="conditional">
	<img src="conditional.png" />
	</div>
	<p>
	</br>
	</br>
	<span style="color:red">
	A keyword.
	</span></br></br>
	<span style="color:yellow">
	A condition.
	</span></br></br>
	<span style="color:blue">
	A colon.
	</span></br></br>
	<span style="color:white">
	The code to be executed if the condition is true.
	</span></br></br>
	</p>
	<div>
	</div>
	<p>I will get to <code>else</code> in a moment</p>
	<h4>How do Conditionals Work?</h4>
	<p>
	When your code is run, python will look through each component in order and check its condition. Once it finds a condition that is true, it will execute that component's code and then skip the rest of the components. So <b>the first component who's condition is true the only one that has it's code run</b>. This is useful if you have many pieces of code for completely different situations and only want one to execute per situation.

	<h3>Rules for Writing Conditionals</h3>
	<h4>Keywords</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>First component has an <code>if</code></li>
		<li>Subsequent components have <code>elif</code></li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Conditions</h4>
	<p>
	Any expression works for a condition.
	</p>
	<h4>Code</h4>
	<p>
	The code should be indented and you can use loops, expressions and/or more conditionals. Other than that it is completely up to you!
	</p>
	<h4>Optional <code>else</code></h4>
	<p>
	If you have multiple components, your final one can be a simple <code>else</code> statement:
	</p>
	<p><code>
	else:</br>
	&nbsp;some code
	</code></p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<h2>Writing Conditionals</h2>
	<div class="subsubject">
	<h4>The Syntax</h4>
	<p>
	The components in a conditional are written in the following way:
	</p>
	<p>
	<code>keword condition:</br>
	&nbsp;some code</code>
	</p>
	<p>
	And each of these components follow each other with no gaps in between them. Like:
	</p>
	<p><code>
	keyword1 condition1:</br>
	&nbsp;some code</br>
	keyword2 condition2:</br>
	&nbsp;some code</br>
	</code></p>
	<h4>The Keywords</h4>
	<p>
	Here are the rules:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The keyword for the first component is "if".</li>
		<li>The keyword for the rest of the components is "elif".</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	So, for example, the above would become:
	</p>
	<p><code>
	if condition1:</br>
	&nbsp;some code</br>
	elif condition2:</br>
	&nbsp;some code
	</code></p>
	</div>
