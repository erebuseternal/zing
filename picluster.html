        <h2>Why a 4 Node Cluster?</h2>
        <p>From Hadoop, to MongoDB, to Solr there are now many opensource projects
          offering incredible functionality and all with the wonderful property of
          scaling out instead of up. This is done by having them run on top of
          a cluster which shares a network, which in turn allows us to scale our
          application by simply adding more machines (also known as nodes) to the
          cluster.
        </p>
        <p>Of course in order to practice running these technologies in the context
          of a cluster we need a cluster! Now, technologies like MongoDB and Solr
          distribute across a cluster by a method called sharding. Why this is important
          to know at this stage is that in sharding, the nodes of our cluster make
          decisions, keep track of state, and carry out other mechanisms that come
          with running on a cluster by voting. And votes only pass if there is a
          majority that votes together. This of course means that we cannot use
          two nodes only, because the majority in a two node cluster is, well, two.
          This means that both of our nodes always have to be running properly,
          which is honestly not very interesting (there is a lot of stuff in terms of
          application resilience that cannot be played with when all of nodes always
          have to be working). Therefore we need at least 3 nodes in our cluster.
        </p>
        <p>Another consideration is that we would prefer these nodes to have static
          IP addresses rather than the dynamically allocated ones that are normal.
          This simplyfies the configuration side of things incredibly, which allows
          us to focus soley on our applications rather than fussing about with the
          configurations all of the time. But because almost all home routers work
          best with dynamically allocated addresses, we are going to want to create
          an entirely separate network for our nodes. Thus, because we want to allow
          for the possibility of failing some of our nodes (in order to try out
          some of the cool stuff about distributed compting) we are going to want
          the node that provides this network to be separate from the nodes that
          would be part of our application.
        </p>
        <p>These considerations put together - create a cluster computing environment
          to play around with, the need for at least three nodes in order to see
          interesting behavior with technologies that use sharding, and the desire
          for a separate network for our cluster - lead us to the simplest cluster
          we can build that satisfies these: a four node cluster.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Setting Up the Internal Network</h2>
        <p>First, <b>pick the pi that will provide the network</b> and plug the wifi adaptor
          into it and <b>connect to your home network</b>. Next open terminal and <b>run
          the following command</b>:
        </p>
        <p class="code"><code>sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server</code>
        </p>
        <p>This will install a server to provide IP addresses to the nodes in
          your network. Now that that has been installed you no longer need to
          be connected to an external network.
        </p>
        <p>Next we will configure the eth0 interface (which is the ethernet adaptor)
          to use static IP addresses. <b>Edit the file <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code></b>
          on rpi0 so that for eth0 we have:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code>auto eht0</br>
          allow-hotplug eth0</br>
          iface eth0 inet static</br>
          &nbsp;address 192.168.50.1</br>
          &nbsp;netmask 255.255.255.0</br>
          &nbsp;network 192.168.50.0</br>
          &nbsp;broadcast 192.168.50.255</br>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>The next thing we will do is configure the dhcp server. To do this we
          will need the hardware addresses for our ethernet ports. Therefore at
          this point you going to have to <b>pick which raspberry pis are which</b>, and
          we are going to <b>give them distinct names</b> so that we can differentiate between
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have already chosen the pi that will provide your network. We will
          henceforth refer to it as <b>rip0</b>. Now give each of the three remaining pis
          one of the names <b>rpi1, rpi2, and rpi3</b>. Make sure you keep track of which
          is which.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we will go ahead and <b>get the hardware addresses for each</b>. To do this,
          in each pi enter terminal and <b>run the command <code>ifconfig</code></b>. In the
          output <b>find the entry for <code>eth0</code></b>. The value corresponding
          to <b>HWaddr</b> (which should something like <code>b8:27:eb:01:29:15</code>)
          <b>is the hardware address</b> for that pi's ethernet port. Write this down
          somewhere so you have it ready for the step below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to configure our server.
          Go ahead and <b>edit the file <code>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</code></b> on rpi0 so that,
          besides lines which start with a # (which are commented out), we
          have:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code>ddns-update-style none;</br>
            authoritative;</br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;host rpi3 {</br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware ethernet [rpi3 hardware address];</br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed-address 192.168.50.13;</br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;}</br>
            &nbsp;}</br>
            }
          </code>
        </p>
        <p class="note"><i>Note that in the above you should replace [rpi0 hardware address]
          with the hardware address you found for rpi0</i>
        </p>
        <p>Next <b>edit the file <code>/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server</code></b>
          on rpi0 so that besides commented lines it reads:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code>DHCPD_CONF=/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</br>
            DHCPD_PID=/var/run/dhcpd.pid</br>
            INTERFACES="eth0"</br>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>That completes configuring our dhcp server.
        </p>
        <p>Now, <b>for each raspberry pi</b> we need to configure the hosts and
          the hostname. For each then <b>edit <code>/etc/hostname</code></b> so that
          it reads:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code>[hostname]</code>
        </p>
        <p>Then (also for each pi) <b>edit <code>/etc/hosts</code></b> to read:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          <code>127.0.0.1 localhost</br>
            ::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback</br>
            fe00::0 ip6-localnet</br>
            ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix</br>
            ff02::1 ip6-allnodes</br>

            192.168.50.11 rpi1 rpi1.local rpi1.lan rpi1.cluster</br>
            192.168.50.12 rpi2 rpi2.local rpi2.lan rpi2.cluster</br>
            192.168.50.13 rpi3 rpi3.local rpi3.lan rpi3.cluster</br>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p class="note"><i>Note that for rpi0 we would replace [hostname] with rpi0, for
        rpi1, [hostname] would be replaced by rpi1, etc.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          And with that our internal network has been configured. <b>Now, shutdown all
          four pis</b>. Then, using the USB to microUSB cables <b>plug each pi into
          the</b> (currently unplugged) <b>USB charging hub</b>. Next using the
          ethernet cables, <b>plug the pis into the ethernet switch</b> (which should base
          plugged in). Now, when you <b>boot up the raspberry pis</b> by plugging
          in the USB charging hub, your internal network should set itself up
          and you should be good to go!
        </p>
        <p class="note"><i>To check that things are working enter rpi0 and run <code>ifconfig</code>.
          Check that the eth0 IP address is 192.168.50.1. Then try to ssh from rpi0 into,

        </p>
        <p class="note"><i>If things don't work check for typos in your edits and make
