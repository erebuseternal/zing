Updates
update(query, update_document, is_upsert, is_for_all)

$inc, $set, $unset, $addToSet, $push, $pull, $pop, $each, $slice, $sort
document.attribute, list.index

we have a list of statements each of these modifiers $inc, $set, $unset, $addToSet,
$push, $pull, $pop goes on the outside, we have a colon, and then we have a document
containing the input to that modifier. If it is a simple key value pair, then we have
just that separated by a colon. But, for example, if we have a complex value (like
an $each) then we get {key : {$each : array}}. Note our just normal value can
be a document.

$slice and $sort can only be used with $each (and is part of the document $each is
an attribute for).  $sort has to be used on an element of the documents being added
to a list it takes as its value a document containing as key that attribute, and as
value a 1 or -1 designating sort order. $slice take a negative value, and is the
number of elements you want to keep.

Finally because everything is documents, you can attributes by object.attribute.
In the case of lists if you have an object that has a list of objects you can do the
same using: object.index.attribute

Queries
find(query, to_keep)
.sort
.limit
.skip
lazily evaluated, (therefore order doesn't matter)

returns cursor
while (cursor.hasNext()){
cursor.next()
}

$gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $ne, $in, $nin, $or, $and, $not,
$all, $size, $slice, $elemMatch, $where

For queries we have a document composed of a series of statements
each of these statements must be true for each document grabbed by
the query. A statement, is either a logic statement, with $not, $and,
or $or, or it is a $where statement, or it is a attribute of the document,
colon, and a 'value'. Values can either be an actual value, or they
can be a conditional document. A conditional document uses
$gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $ne, $in, $nin, $all, $size or $elemMatch, and can
potentially have many of these (if it makes sense) [separated by commas./mongod]. $in, $nin take lists
$and and $or take lists of the same statements that make up a query. The
statements at the top level are not surrounded by curly braces, but the ones
inside are.

Collections are a list of documents, unless you use .snapshot (which moves
through ids), you move down the list. If an element in the collection
changes place, you will have the chance of seeing it many times in the same
cursor.
