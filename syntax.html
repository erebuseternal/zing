	<h1>Syntax for Tools Written in Multiple Lines</h1>
	<div class="subject">
	<p>
	In what follows we are going to talk about tools in python that always require many lines of code. Each of these tools allow us to run code in a different way from the rest a program. And each of these tools are made from blocks that share the same written form. I would like to show you that form now.
	</p>
	<div class="multiline">
	<img src="multiline.png">
	</div>
	<p>
	Each blocks takes:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>a <span style="color:red">keyword</span> to specify what kind of block this is</li>
		<li>some <span style="color:yellow">identifying text</span> to differentiate this block from others like it</li>
		<li>a <span style="color:blue">colon</span></li>
		<li>and, in the following lines, the <span style="color:white">code</span> attached to this block</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Now the rules for the <span style="color:red">keyword</span>, <span style="color:yellow">identifying text</span>, and <span style="color:white">code</span> change depending on the block type. We will learn these later. But there is one rule that holds true for all block types: 
	</p>
	<i>the <span style="color:white">code</span> must always be indented right with respect to the <span style="color:red">keyword</span></i>.
	</p>
	This is because the <span style="color:white">code</span> in your block is going to get run differently from the code outside it. Therefore you indent the <span style="color:white">code</span> inside so python can distinguish it from the rest of your code.
